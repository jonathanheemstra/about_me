      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Born in the midwest and raised on the west coast I have grown up loving all things PNW. Coffee, Rain, and the Seattle Mariners are just a few of my favorite things. I am passionate about the outdoors and you will most likely find me rock climbing, backcountry skiing, or hiking on the weekends.</p>
      <h3>Why you will love working with me</h3>
      <p>I have an unrelenting curiosity and desire to learn new things. I find new problems not only exciting but invigorating and I greatly enjoy seeking out the why as much as the results. I enjoy finding creative solutions to challenging problems.</p>
